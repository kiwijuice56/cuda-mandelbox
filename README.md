Ray marcher implementation to render fractals in c++ with CUDA. This program is currently in development
and only supports the mandelbox and primitives.

## Attribution
The program uses the stb_image_write header file (from https://github.com/nothings/stb) 
to save renders as images. It is included in the repository for
ease of use because it is under the MIT license, but I did not develop it.
